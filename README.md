Open Badges 3.0 credential samples for MIT Learn course certificates

Links to signed versions of the credentials, along with QR codes for each link, are available [here](certificates/certificates.md). These examples would be signed by the issuer and downloaded to be manually added to a mobile wlalet like the LCW, not issued to the wallet speciifcally.

You can use those links to open the credentials in [Verifier Plus](https://verifierplus.org) or add them to the [Learner Credential Wallet.](https://www.lcw.app) 

Example of a VC:

## Recommended properties

The DCC recommends using the [Open Badges 3.0 specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0). Open Badges 3.0 is compatible with [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/), but it has its own requirements and recommendations to support education credentials. 

The following Open Badges 3.0 properties are displayed in the DCC's [Learner Credential Wallet](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/learner-credential-wallet) and [Verifier Plus](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/web-verifier-plus).

Notes: 
- Type of credentialSubject	is AchievementSubject, and credentialSubject is under AchievementCredential. OpenBadgeCredential is an alias to AchievementCredential, which is defined under the parent/root level “type". This is why we define the `context`, `id`, `type`, issuer object, etc., as under `achievementCredential`.
- Open badges are VC's that are specified by a "type" of Achievement Subject under the credentialSubject. Achievement Subject is the credentialSubject for VCs.  Open badges are VC's that are specified by a "type" of Achievement Subject under the credentialSubject. In the example above for an open badge, the credentialSubject will have a type of "AchievementSubject".
- A verifiable credential(VC) MUST contain a credentialSubject property.
- The OBV3 specification is based on the core VC specification, which has different property requirements. Neither the credentialSubject nor id are required for VC's, whereas for the OBV3 specification, credentialSubject IS required, but is is not.
- The value of the credentialSubject property is a set of objects where each object MUST be the subject of one or more claims, which MUST be serialized inside the credentialSubject property. Each object MAY also contain an id property to identify the subject.
